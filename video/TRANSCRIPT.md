# Project video transcript

In 2019, a new corona-virus was identified and had changed the humanity's society tremendously. How should we face the "after-covid-19" era becomes the top issue.

Our Team YYJS will present you the dashboard showing the worldwide impacts of Covid-19 from multiple dimensions.  Including health, education and economics.

So first thing first, in the home page we have an interactive map that show us how things were changed during these two years. As we can see, there are four dimensions that we can pick. They are daily confirm, daily death, school status and GDP. So for example, we can choose school status and toggle the slider button to move time forward. And we can see that most countries reopened their schools after a year of closure.

There are another feature in our homepage. That is our countries comparison tool. By using this tool, we can compare all dimensions in one place. So for example, we can add Australia by clicking the Australia in the world map. And we can set the X-axis to GDP, and the Y-axis to School Status. And the bubble size to the daily confirm. Then, we can click on the plot button, we can see all the countries are lying in the same bubble chart with the columns we choose. 

Now, we can go the health section. The first chart is a global map with bubbles. As we move the slider forward, the bubbles become bigger in each countries. Because there are more and more covid-19 confirmed in this world as time goes by.The second chart is a bar chart that can filter these confirmed or death data by specific orders. For example, we can filter top 10 and order by their value or their GDP. The final chart is a vaccinated map, we can see the color scale showing the vaccinated rate for each country. And we can click on the country  to see the pie chart for vaccinated rate. And a line chart showing the total confirmed number during the time.  And there is one thing to note that these three charts are responsive, it will resize when we change the browser's size like this. 

For the education section, the first horizontal dendrogram introduce the affected regions based on different cluster. In this case countries are group by continents. And countries with red colors are those being affected.The second global map presents how school closure status change with time changes like this.For the third chart, is a bar chart that can filter data like fully closed And we can filter these data by click on the button. The final chart, is a donut chart showing the affected learners comparison with animations. 

The final section is the economy section, in this section we have three charts. The first chart is the GDP tree map for the major economies in this world. The second chart is a heat map showing the global unemployment rate. And final chart is the chord chart represents the import and export between top 5 GDP countries.  And we can click on the buttons above to see how things change before and after the covid-19 like this.

That is all for today. Thank you for watching the video.
