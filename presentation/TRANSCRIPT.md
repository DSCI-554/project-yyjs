## Slide 1
As two of our team members are remote this semester, so Yang and Yiwei will be as team representatives do this presentation.
## Slide 2
Let's use 10 words to introduce our project: presenting impacts of COVID-19 in public health, education, and economy. Our audiences are those who would like to know how COVID-19 influences our life in multiple dimensions. We hope the designed dashboard is helpful for people to timely know the global COVID-19 information from several aspects.
## Slide 3
We designed the goal and mainframe together, and each of us is in charge of doing one subpage, 
SHIHAO implements the web framework design, the health page is implemented by Yang, Yiwei works on the education page, and JIAYI is responsible for the economic section. 
## Slide 4
To understand the project, users should have a basic understanding of what is the coronavirus pandemic. We utilized four data sets in our work:Public Health, Education,Economy,Spatial Data.
## Slide 5
As the existing data visualization of analyzing the impacts of Covid-19, the famous organizations, like JHU and the website of Our World in Data, have done mainly focusing on public health. The following screenshots are from their websites.
## Slide 6
We made our dashboard original by combining the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on various aspects as a whole by displaying on interactive Mapbox choropleth and d3 charts. Our work enables users to simultaneously compare the burden of covid-19 in different countries on the dimension of health, education, and economy.
## Slide 7
To ensure the usability and consistency of the dashboard ui, We designed a prototype in sigma before coding it in VUE, 
The layout of our dashboard is based on a navigation menu with four pages, each indicating covid-19 impact in one single dimension, the design was depending  on the collected data to optimize different visual queries.
## Slide 8
We used Bootstrap-vue to build the mainframe in our dashboard, and visualized the collected data by Mapbox map and multiple D3 graphic generations (D3 layout, interactive and responsive  D3 maps, and animated D3 chart).
## Slide 9
If we could start this project again, we would first integrate the data together into a single data set before the d3 graphic design. It would allow us to develop the project in a more systematic way. Then we would add more dimensions, like international travel, food, and e-commerce to offer users a more comprehensive view of covid-19 global impacts .
## Slide 10
To summarize my main points; through visualizing these collected data in health, education, and economy, we can more impersonally and deeply understand how the virus of COVID-19 tremendously impacts the globe in all these aspects.
